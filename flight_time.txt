Algorithm for numberical approximation of flight time.

This document outlines a numerical approach for calculating the flight time of a constantly thrusting spacecraft on a hyperbolic orbit. The algorithm will be implemented in flight_time.py and used to calculate the time it takes for Einstein to reach the sun's focal point. This will be incorporated into the third scientific appendix.

There are two steps to the approach, each of which is outlined in greater detail. The continuous thrust of the engine is modeled as a chain of discrete, instantaneous increases in velocity interceded with coasting periods.

Step 1 - burn phase

The spacecraft's velocity changes instantaneously. The new orbit AND the state of the spacecraft along the orbit are calculated.

Step 2 - coast phase

The spacecraft coasts for a period of time. The spacecraft's orbit does not change but the state (position and velocity) change and are calculated.


Below is additional detail on the two steps.


Step 1 - burn phase

1. The spacecraft's velocity instantaneously increases a certain amount. The fuel on the
   craft is decremented. The velocity change and fuel change account for the reduction in mass.

2. The spacecraft's r and v are known. R has not changed during the instantaneous burn. 
   The semi-major axis is recalculated from the vis-viva equation
