Algorithm for numberical approximation of flight time.

This document outlines a numerical approach for calculating the flight time of a constantly thrusting spacecraft on a hyperbolic orbit. The algorithm will be implemented in flight_time.py and used to calculate the time it takes for Einstein to reach the sun's focal point. This will be incorporated into the third scientific appendix.

There are two steps to the approach, each of which is outlined in greater detail. The continuous thrust of the engine is modeled as a chain of discrete, instantaneous increases in velocity interceded with coasting periods.

Step 1 - burn phase

The spacecraft's velocity changes instantaneously. The new orbit AND the state of the spacecraft along the orbit are calculated.

Step 2 - coast phase

The spacecraft coasts for a period of time. The spacecraft's orbit does not change but the state (position and velocity) change and are calculated.
